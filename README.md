  ## Installation
  The user needs access to their terminal, the files in this directory, and have node.js installed on their machine. They will also need to install the inquirer and jest packages if they had not already done so.

  ## Usage
  This program runs entirely out of the terminal. To run it: 
  
  1. The user will first open a terminal session. 
  2. Then they will navigate to the directory where this application is run out of. 
  3. Then, by typing the command "node index.js" they will begin running the application. 
  4. The user will enter their answers for a series of prompts, and then the application will render an HTML file.
  5. The application finishes running once the user has selected "Finish," indicating that they have no more employees to enter.
  6. The HTML file will include built-in styling and display a team profile site based on the employees the user entered into the prompts.
